\section{RELEVANT MATHEMATICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT}
\subsection{MATHEMATICAL MODEL}
	A mathematical model is a description of system using mathematical concepts and language.  A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behaviour.
	
	Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include logical models.
	
	In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments. Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed.

\section{PROJECT IDEA}
The overall Idea of the project is to provide user with before hand daily health related risks based on user's daily routine and weather changes as well as historic health data. The project's idea is to formulate a efficient Electronic Health Record so that the prediction is most accurate. 

\section{MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT}
It is evident from the historic data as well as human knowledge that human general health is closely related to the climatic conditions and the occurrence of diseases is greatly affected by the climate change. This inference gave us the motivation to apply advanced computer science concepts like machine learning and data mining to the health data available to extract certain knowledge and apply it to the current realtime health data so that future occurrence of diseases can be accurately predicted.

\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}
\textbf{1.Data Driven Analytics for Personalized Healthcare Jianying Hu,Adam Perer , and Fei Wang, Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016 C.A. Weaver et al, Healthcare Information Management Systems- Cases, Strategies, and Solutions, Health Informatics,DOI 10.1007}

The concept of Learning Health Systems (LHS) is gaining momentum as
more and more electronic healthcare data becomes increasingly accessible. The core
idea is to enable learning from the collective experience of a care delivery network
as recorded in the observational data, to iteratively improve care quality as care is
being provided in a real world setting. In line with this vision, much recent research
effort has been devoted to exploring machine learning, data mining and data visualization methodologies that can be used to derive real world evidence from diverse
sources of healthcare data to provide personalized decision support for care delivery
and care management. It gives an overview of a wide range of
analytics and visualization components  have developed, examples of clinical
insights reached from these components, and some new directions are taken.

\textbf{2.Curve relativity analyse for relationship between blood pressure and atmospheric
temperature using Matlab, 2009 International Conference on E-Learning, E-Business, Enterprise Information Systems, and E-Government}
	
Although there are many evidence indicated that human
blood pressure is influenced by atmospheric temperature ,
there are not useful method or tool use to evaluating the
correlation relationship between atmospheric temperature
and BP(blood pressure) still .The paper collected a serial
date of atmospheric temperature and BP which were
recorded by a family .The atmospheric temperature data
were reported by weather bureau and the BP data were
measured by oneself in electronic blood-pressure
meter(HEM6000) .It was made in Japan by OMRON
company . Everyday BP was measured for two times .In the
morning, the blood-pressure was marked for a.m. BP then in
the afternoon ,the blood-pressure was marked for p.m. BP
.there are six groups data we used to experiment. All of them
include a.m. SBP(shrink blood pressure),a.m. DBP(distend
blood pressure), p.m. SBP, p.m. DBP LT(lowest atmospheric
temperature) HT(highest atmospheric temperature) .Each of
them was recorded during 90 days from day to day. The
characters of them are discrete and there are some random
error exist .There are no general methods ready to evaluate
the relationship between them. For evaluating the
relationship between them objectively .The paper used many
methods and analysed from different aspect to make sure
how the correlation degree are among each others 
.

\textbf{4.A soft-computing ensemble approach (SEA) to forecast Indian summer
monsoon rainfall, Nisha Kurian, a T. Venugopal, b Jatin Singh a and M. M. Ali *
b
a
Skymet Weather Services, Noida, India
Department of Physics, Novosibirsk State University, Russia}

Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy and contributes âˆ¼16percent of gross domestic product and about
10percent of total exports. Hence, accurate and timely forecasting of monthly Indian summer monsoon rainfall is very much in
demand for economic planning and agricultural practices. Several methods and models, comprising dynamic and statistical
models and combinations of the two, exist for monsoon forecasting. Here, a multi-model ensemble approach, combined with
an artificial neural networking technique, was used to develop a soft-computing ensemble algorithm (SEA) to forecast the
monthly and seasonal rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. Forecasts using January to May initial conditions along with
observations during 1982â€“2014 were used to develop the model. The SEA compares well with observations.

\textbf{5.Climate
Change And
Infectious
Diseases}

Changes in infectious disease
transmission patterns are a likely
major consequence of climate
change. It is needed to learn more
about the underlying complex
causal relationships, and apply this
information to the prediction of
future impacts, using more
complete, better validate.

\textbf{6.Extreme Allergies and Global Warming
National wildlife federation, 2010}

Unchecked global warming will worsen respiratory allergies for
approximately 25 million Americans. Ragweedâ€”â€“the primary allergen
trigger of fall hay feverâ€”â€“grows faster, produces more pollen per
plant, and has higher allergenic content under increased carbon
dioxide levels. Longer growing seasons under a warmer climate allow
for bigger ragweed plants that produce more pollen later into the fall.
Springtime allergies to tree pollens also could get worse. Warmer
temperatures could allow significant expansion of the habitat
suitable for oaks and hickories, which are two highly allergenic tree
species. Changing climate conditions may even affect the amount of
fungal allergens in the air.
More airborne allergens could mean more asthma attacks for the
approximately 10 million Americans with allergic asthma. Global
warming may also exacerbate air pollution, which interacts with
allergens to trigger more severe asthma attacks. Cities pose the
biggest health threats for asthmatics because the urban heat island
effect can exacerbate both pollen production and air pollution. These
potential impacts of global warming could have a significant
economic impact: allergies and asthma already cost the United
States more than 32 billion annually in direct health care costs and
lost productivity.
Poison ivy also grows faster and is more toxic when carbon dioxide
increases in the atmosphere. More than 350,000 cases of contact
dermatitis from exposure to poison ivy are already reported in the
United States each year. These numbers are likely to increase if
poison ivy grows faster and becomes more abundant. The reactions
may also become more severe because poison ivy produces a more
potent form of urushiol, the allergenic substance, when carbon
dioxide levels are higher.
We must act now to reduce risks for allergy and asthma sufferers.
An essential first step is to reduce global warming pollution to avoid
the worst impacts, and enable allergy sufferers to continue enjoying
the great outdoors. At the same time, states, communities, and
home owners should undertake smart community planning and
landscaping, with attention to allergenic plants and urban heat island
effects, to limit the amount of pollen and other allergens that
become airborne.

\chapter{PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SCOPE}
\newpage
\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
In our project we intend to analyse the data available for various patients of certain diseases which are primarily affected by change in daily routine , climate and diet   . from this analysis we recognize certain pattern related to symptoms , cause and treatment of the disease . Based on this analysis we create a model to predict the risks , prevention and precautions to be taken by the patients with similar pattern . Also the prediction will be supported by the climate forecast and current changes in medical health of the patient . Based on the analysed and detected patterns , the current medical health and climate changes to be confronted by the patient we aim to give in advance prediction to the patient . We also intend to provide the precautionary methods . Along with prediction we intend to prompt the patient about taking care of his health based on his personal health status and the climate changes  .

\section{Technical feasibility}
\subsection{Hardware feasibility}
The hardware components are required mainly to increase the speed of training
the neural network and test time implementation. GPU has also been used to train
the same model and the same dataset which gives an extremely high performance of
training and opens a window for datasets having large number of training examples
or even those datasets having larger number of features.
\subsection{Software feasibility}
The software components used in this project are open source libraries and plat-
forms. Python is the primary programming language used to implement the project.
In order to build neural network models keras open source library has been used
which provides a simpler way to code the model along with open source library for
machine learning which is Tensorflow as a backend for keras implementation. Also
R studio has been used to analyse the data.
\section{Economical feasibility}
The software and the hardware part of the project implementation doesn't require
any cost so far. Due to use of free and open source libraries for deep learning, optimization and preprocessing for the software part which doesn't incur any cost for training the model.
\section{Schedule feasibility}
The solution would be built in an estimated time of 7-8 months.The model
building,training and implementation would be divided into sequential phases as each
component in the project is functionally dependent on the previous one. Time constraints have been imposed for every phase and especially in the phase of increasing
accuracy and fine tuning the parameters of the model and making it more robust.

\section{Operational feasibility}
The system would be used for patients to self test their health and get predictions of diseases based on the changing weather.

\section{UML modeling}
The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modelling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to provide a standard
way to visualize the design of a system.UML is a standard language for specifying,
visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. UML
was created by Object Management Group and UML 1.0 specification draft was pro-
posed to the OMG in January 1997.
\subsection{Goals of UML:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide users with a ready-to-use, expressive visual modeling language so they
can develop and exchange meaningful models.
\item Provide extensibility and specialization mechanisms to extend the core concepts.
\item Be independent of particular programming languages and development pro-
cesses.Integrate best practices
\item Provide a formal basis for understanding the modelling language.
\item Encourage the growth of the OO tools market.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{UML diagrams for the project:}
\subsubsection{Use Case diagram}
Use case diagrams are usually referred to as behaviour diagrams used to describe a set of actions (use cases) that some system or systems (subject) should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors).

		\end{center}
	\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Activity diagram}
Activity diagrams are graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with support for choice, iteration and concurrency. In the Unified Modelling Language, activity diagrams are intended to model both computational and organizational processes (i.e. workflows).\\

		\caption{Activity Diagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Component diagram}
Component diagram is a special kind of diagram in UML. The purpose is also different from all other diagrams discussed so far. It does not describe the functionality of the system but it describes the components used to make those functionalities.\\

		\caption{Component Diagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Deployment diagram}
Deployment diagram is a structure diagram which shows architecture of the system as deployment (distribution) of software artifacts to deployment targets. Artifacts represent concrete elements in the physical world that are the result of a development process.

\subsubsection{Sequence diagram}
A sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how objects operate with one another and in what order. It is a construct of a message sequence chart. A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence.\\

		\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{5.png}}
		\caption{Sequence Diagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Interaction diagram}
Interaction diagrams are models that describe how a group of objects collaborate in some behavior - typically a single use-case. The diagrams show a number of example objects and the messages that are passed between these objects within the use-case.\\

		\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{6.png}}
		\caption{Interaction Diagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Statechart diagram}
A state diagram, also called a state machine diagram or statechart diagram, is an illustration of the states an object can attain as well as the transitions between those states in the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\\
